# PNAS-HBVPAC
Relevant code will be presented here for article entitled "Dynamic Heart-to-Brain Modulation in Sleep Characterized by Variational Phase-Amplitude Coupling Framework" for peer review of PNAS.

Here, we present a demo of HB-VPAC in the experiment of anti-nonlinearity by using nonlinear simulated coupled signal. First, add the path of directory 'SimulatedSignal', 'ECGSYN', 'Modulation Index', 'VMD', 'EEMD' into the MATLAB. Then, run 'Demo.m' file in 'maincode' directory to validate the effect of HB-VPAC framework. Result is visualized by comodulogram that consists of multiple significant frequnecy pair of MI. Users can choose to use 'VMD', 'EEMD', or 'EMD' method for signal decomposition.
